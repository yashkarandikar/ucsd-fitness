plot avg avg pace vs workout number
see if evolving user is helping for heart rate prediction and avg pace prediction
see paper for different ways of using time
see if applying it for sections of a workout instead of entire workouts work - also try this with heart rate prediction, avg. pace prediction

see difference between parameters for experience levels
verify derivatives in C++ for model 2
other ways of using time evolution (maybe linear interpolation between first and last)
other features
baseline model denom term
compare with baseline models
T test - statistically significant
refactor seconds conversion, experiment with normalization
other measures of error rate : how many examples were classified within reasonable margin?
outlier removal ideas - 
    - remove top 10 % and bottom 10 % by workout
    - remove records within 3 standard deviation
make linear, user, baseline models share preparation part of the pipeline
review prepare_data_set.read_data****
combine training and validation and see if you get back the original training / val
create single user from users who have very few workouts

ideas from evolution paper:
    - is the prediction error for users with higher fitness level lesser than that for users with lower fitness levels? i.e. are "Experts" more predictable?

    - how does the "Experience" or fitness level of a user evolve over time ?
    - how does the fitness level impact the ability of the model to predict duration ?
    - how users progress through fitness levels with time?
    - how users who stop working out differ from user who continue working out ?
    - how do users achieve high fitness levels? through working out longer distances every time or repeating the same multiple times?
    - do users who do both Cycling and Running achieve greater fitness level than those who do just Running ?
    - Compare different models for predicting distance:
        - simple linear model
        - simply find average pace for user and use that to predict duration OR  alpha per user, but one which does not change gradually with each workout i.e. the order of workouts is not considered
        - alpha per user, which changes with every workout i.e. order of workouts is considered
